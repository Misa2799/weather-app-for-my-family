# ‚òÄÔ∏è Sachiko and Komugi's weather üåßÔ∏è

This project, "Sachiko and Komugi's Weather," aims to help prevent heat stroke by providing a clear visualization of the best times for Sachiko and Komugi to go for a walk. I believe that this will help them avoid the dangers of heat stroke.

Both dogs and people can suffer from heat stroke when walking in hot weather. Older people are not only more sensitive to heat, but they are also less aware of rising temperatures and thirst. The incidence of heat stroke is higher in the elderly compared to younger adults. For dogs, the risk is even greater because, unlike humans, they cannot sweat and are covered in fur. Additionally, they walk close to the ground, where they are exposed to even more heat.

Sachiko, in her late 70s, and Komugi, an elderly dog estimated to be 11 years old, are both at a higher risk of heat stroke than I am (in my 30s). However, Sachiko is less likely to notice that she is feeling unwell due to her reduced sensory functions, and Komugi cannot express her discomfort because she is unable to communicate through language. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize the possibility of heat stroke for both of them.
